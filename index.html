    <h2>Congraulations, The Queen!</h2>

    <img src="image.jpg" alt="picture" class="image2">
    <p>Dearest,</p>

    <p>I'm writing this because words sometimes feel too small to contain the immense pride and admiration I have for
      you. Congratulations, on this incredible achievement. I’m simply speechless, and I am
      overflowing with joy for you. Watching you work so hard, day in and day out, with such determination and grace,
      has been one of the most inspiring experiences of your life. <strong>Masha Allah</strong>, you've done it! This
      success is a testament to your relentless spirit, your incredible intelligence, and your unwavering belief in
      yourself.</p>

    <p>I’ve had the privilege of seeing a side of you that many don’t. I've seen the late nights, the early mornings,
      and the sheer grit you've put into this. Ke abun alfahari da ke, more than you could ever know. This isn't just a
      simple victory; it's a profound statement of who you are. It’s a message to the world that you are a force to be
      reckoned with, and I'm so honored to be a part of your journey, a witness to your greatness. This isn't just
      about reaching a goal, it's about the woman you have become in the process; stronger, more confident, and even
      more brilliant.</p>

    <p>I remember you telling me about your dreams, about the things you wanted to achieve. You spoke with such
      passion, such clarity, and I could see the fire in your eyes. <strong>Kamar yadda aka ce, 'aiki tukuru, nasara
        ce',</strong> and you have proven that truth a thousand times over. Aiki tukuru da kika yi, hakika ya haifar da
      nasara. Wannan abin da kika cimma a yau babban mataki ne, kuma na sani farkon nasarori ne masu yawa da za su biyo
      baya. Gaba taki ce mai haske, kuma ba zan gaji da jiran duk abubuwan alheri da za ki yi ba.</p>

    <p>Please take a moment to breathe and truly appreciate this moment. You deserve all the good things that are
      coming your way. Your kindness, your compassion, and your unwavering commitment to your goals make you a person
      worthy of the highest praise. I find myself constantly in awe of you. The work of your hands, <strong>ayukan
        hannunki</strong>, has yielded a harvest that will feed your soul and inspire everyone around you. You are a
      beacon of hope and a living example of what true dedication can achieve. <strong>Gaskiya, babu mai cewa ba
        gaskiya ba ne</strong> truly, no one can deny this truth.</p>

    <p>Every single bit of effort you invested has paid off. Every sacrifice you made, every challenge you overcame,
      every moment of doubt you pushed through has led you to this point. I want you to know that you are not just
      celebrating this achievement, you are celebrating yourself. You are celebrating your courage, your resilience,
      and your extraordinary mind. I love of seeing you happy and successful brings me more joy than anything else.</p>

    <p>This is a day for celebration. A day to reflect on how far you've come and to look forward to the limitless
      possibilities that lie ahead. <strong>Allah ya kara miki basira</strong>, may God give you more wisdom, and may
      your journey continue to be filled with blessings. Aisha, know that I am and will always be your number one
      fan, your biggest supporter, and the one who will always be in your corner.</p>

    <p>With all my regard,</p>

    <p><strong>Abubakar<br>Muhammad<br>Nakaduna</strong></p>

      <h3>A Poem of Praise</h3>

      بِاسْمِ الَّذِي سَمَا بِالْأَفْكَا ***                 
                        ***وَأَنْزَلَ الْعَقْلَ كَأَعْظَمِ الْأَسْرَارِ
      يَا مَنْ أَنْشَأْتِ صَرْحًا مِنَ الْإِصْرَارِ ***      
                        ***وَتَوَّجْتِ جَبْهَتَكِ بِالْأَنْوَارِ
      فِي كُلِّ خُطْوَةٍ نَجْمٌ قَدْ نَارَ***
                        ***وَفِي كُلِّ نَظْرَةٍ أَمَلٌ قَدْ سَارَ
      أَنْتِ الْعَزْمُ الَّذِي لَا يَنْكَسِرُ***
                        ***وَالْحُلْمُ الَّذِي بِجُهْدِكِ يَزْدَهِرُ
      فَأَبْشِرِي بِأَعْلَى الْمَقَامَاتِ *** 
                        ***وَبِالنُّورِ يَتَبِعُ الْخُطُوَاتِ
      إِنَّ الْيَوْمَ يَوْمُكِ، وَالْأَمْسُ وَغَدًا لَكِ*** 
                        ***فَأَنْتِ نَصْرٌ، وَالْكَوْنُ يُبَارِكُ لَكِ
      بَارَكَ اللَّهُ فِيكِ وَفِي عَمَلِكِ*** 
                        ***وَأَدَامَ الْيُسْرَ وَالْفَرَحَ فِي قَلْبِكِ
